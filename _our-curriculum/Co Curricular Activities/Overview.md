### **Co-Curricular Activities**

CCA programme in the school plays a key role in the holistic development of our students. It focuses on development of specific knowledge, skills and values based on the studentâ€™s choice of CCA ranging from Sports, Aesthetics (Visual and Performing Arts), Clubs to Uniformed Group. CCA enables students to discover their interests and talents while providing a platform for friendships and social integration of students from diverse backgrounds.  
  
The School offers 17 different CCAs ranging from Sports, Aesthetics, Clubs to Uniformed Group. All P3 to P6 students are strongly encouraged to participate in at least one CCA..
