### **Club, Societies and Uniform Groups**

<b style="color:#016C62; font-size:22px; line-height: 3;">Art Club</b><br>
The Art Club aims to inspire and nurture budding and talented artists in the school. Students develop their interest as they engage themselves through the different art forms such as Drawing, Painting, Craftwork and Digital Art. The mix of traditional and non-traditional mediums allow our students to express themselves freely as they expand their creativity and imagination. Students in Art Club are exposed to different art styles, artists and art movements through visits to art galleries and museums to increase studentsâ€™ appreciation and awareness of Art.
