### **Sports CCA**

<b style="color:#016C62; font-size:22px; line-height: 3;">Hockey</b><br>
A team game played between two teams of players each, using hooked sticks with which the players try to drive a small hard ball towards goals at opposite ends of a field outdoors. The Hockey CCA aims to develop passion and love for this Olympic sport in all of its members. Students have the opportunity to display the values of sportsmanship, perseverance and teamwork through the CCA sessions. Students are able to forge friendships and strong camaraderie amongst their team members as they pursue sporting excellence through participation in National School Games at Senior and Junior Divisions. Our Hockey CCA achievements at zonal and NSG competitions have been remarkable.

A team possession/invasion game played between two teams of players, each using a plastic manipulative (stick) to drive an air flow ball towards the opponent's goal in an indoor court. Floorball has seen a rise in popularity among youths in the last decade, with our Singapore Teams clinching the gold medals in the SEA Games. It is an intensive and competitive sport CCA which helps develop physical fitness, self-discipline, resilience and teamwork. Our Floorball players go through a comprehensive training programme that not only develops and hones the technical skills such as dribbling, passing and tackling, but also tactical concepts of attack and defence. Our students get to display their learning through participation in National School Games at Senior and Junior Divisions.
