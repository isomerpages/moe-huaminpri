### **Hockey**

A team game played between two teams of players each, using hooked sticks with which the players try to drive a small hard ball towards goals at opposite ends of a field outdoors. The Hockey CCA aims to develop passion and love for this Olympic sport in all of its members. Students have the opportunity to display the values of sportsmanship, perseverance and teamwork through the CCA sessions. Students are able to forge friendships and strong camaraderie amongst their team members as they pursue sporting excellence through participation in National School Games at Senior and Junior Divisions. Our Hockey CCA achievements at zonal and NSG competitions have been remarkable.
