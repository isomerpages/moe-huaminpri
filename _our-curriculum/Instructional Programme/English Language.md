<b style="color:#038C7F; font-size:17px; ">Passionate and Effective Users of Good English (PEG for Life)!</b><br>
English is a key language used in Singapore and is used in everyday situations. It is also used for functional purposes, such as giving directions, information or instructions and making requests. It is therefore important that our students be equipped with these skills in language learning:

•	Listening & Viewing <br>
•	Reading & Viewing<br>
•	Speaking & Representing<br>
•	Writing & Representing<br>
•	Grammar<br>
•	Vocabulary<br>

<b style="color:#016C62; font-size:20px; line-height: 3;">OUR MISSION</b><br>
By creating a dynamic learning environment where students cultivate a passion for learning English, we seek to develop self-directed learners who are discerning readers, empathetic communicators and creative inquirers

<b style="color:#016C62; font-size:20px; line-height: 3;">OUR PHILOSOPHY</b><br>
We believe that every student wants and is able to learn and quality teaching & learning is based on student-centric teaching approaches. In line with the English Language Syllabus 2020, our department focuses on the development, reinforcement and extension of language skills through an enjoyment of the language and the promotion of extensive reading; and leveraging oracy, reading and writing skills to develop knowledge and independent use of the language.
