### **Science**

<b style="color:#016C62; font-size:20px; line-height: 3;">OUR MISSION</b><br>
<b style="color:#038C7F; font-size:17px; ">Passionate and Effective Users of Good English (PEG for Life)!</b><br>
To equip students with skills to understand the world and make informed decisions

<b style="color:#016C62; font-size:20px; line-height: 3;">OUR AIM</b><br>
We aim to provide our students with learning experiences which stimulate curiosity and opportunities to develop their process skills for scientific inquiry.

<b style="color:#016C62; font-size:20px; line-height: 3;">OUR APPROACH</b><br>
The department uses the Inquiry-based learning approach to teaching Science. This is aligned to MOE’s Primary Science Syllabus (2014) and our school’s vision. Students are taken through 5 key stages of learning in the 5E Instructional Model - Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate and Evaluate – as they discover and reinforce the learning of Science concepts. We provide opportunities to stimulate curiosity in students to explore within and outside the classroom through:

1\. Laboratory Sessions <br>
2\. Learning Journeys <br>
3\. Interdisciplinary Project work <br>
4\. Use of ICT <br>
5\. Participation in external competitions e.g. Elementz, Science Olympiad, ICAS <br>
6\. Environment Education <br>

<b style="color:#016C62; font-size:20px; line-height: 3;">THE HOLISTIC APPROACH</b><br>
A range of assessment tools, including written and performance tasks are used to provide feedback to the students on their mastery of concepts and skills as well as their strengths and areas for improvement. The various modes of assessment include:

• Continual and Semestral Examinations  
• Formative assessment during lessons  
• Interdisciplinary Project Work  
• Online tests and quizzes
