ICT infusion in daily lessons serves to help our students become self-directed and collaborative learners. It is aligned to the 21st century competencies and baseline ICT skills. Every Huaminite is required to attain a set of these ICT skills in progressive stages; from simple touch-typing skills to being able to use Microsoft PowerPoint for presentation purposes. The skills are integrated into our subject curriculum to enhance the learning experience of every student.

Teachers leverage on the variety of online platforms, such as Student Learning Space (SLS), Koobits and Google Classroom, to engage students in knowledge creation. This helps them develop better understanding of the concepts and skills taught through the effective use of ICT. Teachers also use these platforms to support assessment for learning and provide differentiation in their instructions.

Technology is therefore being used intentionally to:
* support assessment for learning

* foster conceptual change

* provide differentiation

* facilitate learning together

* develop metacognition

* enable personalisation

* embed scaffold for learning

In Huamin Primary, students also learn about Cyber Wellness. It aims to equip students to become discerning & responsible ICT users. This is in alignment with our school value of being “Responsible and Respectful.” Some of the topics taught in these lessons are signs of cyberbullying, dangers of game addiction and proper netiquette.
