<b style="color:#038C7F; font-size:17px; ">1) Learning Support Programme (LSP)</b><br>
The LSP provides additional support for students with weak literacy skills. Students attend lessons one period a day in small groups, and are taught by specially trained teachers using strategies that will improve their reading ability.  

<b style="color:#038C7F; font-size:17px; ">2) Reading Remediation Programme (RRP) - Primary 3 & 4</b><br>  The Reading Remediation Programme is aimed at supporting P3 students who still face consistent difficulty in reading in the English Language despite having completed the Learning Support Programme in P1 and P2. The programme exposes students to a range of coping strategies for reading comprehension which will enable them to better manage their daily learning. This programme is held in conjunction with the remediation programme for the students at P3 after school.  

<b style="color:#038C7F; font-size:17px; ">3) School Dyslexia Remediation (SDR) - Primary 3 & 4</b><br>
The MOE's School-based Dyslexia Remediation programme is a two-year intervention programme for Primary 3 and 4 students. These students are identified for support through a systematic screening process for dyslexia conducted at the end of Primary 2. The programme is conducted in small groups by trained school personnel using a remediation curriculum designed by MOE Reading Specialists. This programme is held four times a week after curriculum hours.
