Welcome to the MOE Kindergarten @ Huamin (MK@HM) family! We are pleased to invite families who have enrolled for 2023 to our MOE Kindergarten (MK) Orientation to meet our kindergarten teachers and find out more about what to expect when your child joins us in January 2023.   
  
The details of the orientation are:

<b style="color:green; font-size:22px;">4 November 2022  |  K2 Celebrates! 2022</b><br>
We will be holding a special K2 Celebrates! event to mark the completion of our K2 children’s pre-school years. The celebrations reflect our belief in a holistic view of pre-school children’s development. Instead of dressing in a graduation gown and mortar board which places undue emphasis on the academic aspects of development, we place the children at the heart of the celebrations where they were involved in planning and executing the celebrations, showing their capabilities and accomplishments.
