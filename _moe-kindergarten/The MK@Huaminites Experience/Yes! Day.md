### **Yes! Day**

<b style="color:#038C7F; font-size:22px;">Friday is a Yes! Day</b><br>
"Yes! Day" provides the children with longer blocks of time for free play to develop their knowledge, skills, and dispositions. It also provides opportunities for the children to decide what they want to explore and discover! It's a Yes! to whatever they want to do, well, almost anything.

Yes! Day is on every Friday. The children will get to decide:

•Where to play (across the two classrooms)

•How to play, within safe boundaries

•Who to play with

•When to have snacks and who to have snacks with
