### **Healthy Body**

At MK@Huamin, we want to empower children with different ways of staying healthy.This year (2022), we focus on having a "Healthy Body”, with the theme of “All About Eyes” for 2022. Through various activities, the children gained new found eye-care knowledge such as fruits that benefit the health of their eyes and that spending time outdoors is a way to rest our eyes. With that, the children discussed together and created their own “eye care exercise”!

Take a look at our children in action!

As part of an active lifestyle, this month, the children were introduced to Yoga. Yoga is a great physical activity to help children improve body awareness, focus, balance, and flexibility. The children learnt that yoga helps to exercise their bodies, their breath and their minds, all at the same time. During the session, the children attempted different nature-inspired “Asana” (Yoga Poses) which include the tree, mountain and butterfly poses! With imagination at play, children actively participated in yoga with full concentration as they connect more deeply with their inner self.  

You too can try Yoga with your child(ren)! Here's the link to a simple Yoga exercise you can try at home:<br>

This month, we explored the fun of fitness! Apart from having a balanced diet, the children also learned the importance of staying active to keep a healthy mind and body. The children then danced and moved to our ‘Superhero’ zumba session.
