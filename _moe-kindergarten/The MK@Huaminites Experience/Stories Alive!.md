### **Stories Alive**

At MK@Huamin, we want to build and develop in children, a good foundation in literacy. 

Language learning is a dynamic and ongoing process that begins in infancy and early childhood and continues throughout the schooling years. In early childhood, the focus is on developing children’s listening and speaking skills. An active, interactive approach helps to nurture children’s interest in learning languages.

We believe that children’s learning goes beyond the classroom and the environment encourages their exploration. By bringing different stories alive through our environment, we aim to excite, interest and instil a love for learning languages.

Look out for our series of programme and activities of STORIES ALIVE!

In 2021, “Storytelling on the Move”, a termly programme, focuses on instilling a love for language through dramatization. The teachers and the children work together to bring the characters alive through dramatisation and meeting the characters up-close.

This year (2022), "Storytelling on the Move“ brings the children through a journey of exploration and discovery of the elements of the stories in our environment. Using the 5W1H approach, the elements of the stories were planted in our environment (both indoors and outdoors) for the children to discover, discuss and draw inferences. During outdoors and transition time, the children became detectives to search for clues around the school to make inferences to the key elements of a story: setting, plot and characters. The clues varied based on the story and the teachers facilitated different activities to ignite children’s curiosity.

Come and solve the mysteries together!
