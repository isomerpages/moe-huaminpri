### **Stories Alive**

At MK@Huamin, we want to build and develop in children, a good foundation in literacy. 

Language learning is a dynamic and ongoing process that begins in infancy and early childhood and continues throughout the schooling years. In early childhood, the focus is on developing children’s listening and speaking skills. An active, interactive approach helps to nurture children’s interest in learning languages.

We believe that children’s learning goes beyond the classroom and the environment encourages their exploration. By bringing different stories alive through our environment, we aim to excite, interest and instil a love for learning languages.

Look out for our series of programme and activities of STORIES ALIVE!
