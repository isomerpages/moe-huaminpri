### **Our Attire**

All children attending MOE Kindergarten are required to wear their kindergarten uniforms daily, unless otherwise specified (e.g., for certain festivals and celebrations, the kindergarten will notify parents about alternative attire arrangements in advance).

Children are to <b>wear the prescribed kindergarten uniform and modification to the uniform is not allowed.</b>

We recommend that each child has at least three sets of uniform.
