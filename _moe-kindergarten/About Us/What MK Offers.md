MOE Kindergarten offers a 4-hour programme.

Parents who require a full-day service for their children can opt for <b>Kindergarten Care (KCare)</b> which is provided by <b>MERCU Learning Point</b> and based on MOE guidelines.

KCare provides the time and space for children to play, explore and discover in a specially designed environment with carefully chosen resources. Your child will have a variety of play experiences and exposure to different areas of interest.
