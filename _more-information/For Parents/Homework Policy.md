### **Huamin's Homework Policy**
<b>1. Definition of Homework </b><br>
Homework refers to any learning activity that students are required to complete outside of curriculum time. This includes any extension of the classroom work, hardcopy and online assignments and projects but not revision of school work or studying for tests and examinations.

<b>2. Purpose of Homework </b><br>
In Huamin Primary School, we believe that homework is beneficial to our students as it:
*   reinforces learning and deepens understanding of lessons taught
*   allows students to regularly practise and apply skills and concepts taught
*   develops good study habits
*   encourages greater ownership and responsibility for self-directed learning

<b>3. Guidelines on Homework </b><br>
The school is mindful about students’ overall well-being. We want to ensure that they have enough time to rest and take part in social/physical activities with their families or by themselves. The following table illustrates the guidelines for homework for the different levels. These guidelines may be adjusted to better customise to the learning needs of students.

<b>4. Non-Submission and/or Non-Completion of Homework </b><br>
Teachers will work with students to find out the reasons for any non-submission and/or non- completion of homework. If need be, teachers would contact the parent/ legal guardian to inform and seek support. Please take note that non-submission of homework for recalcitrants may constitute a minor offence.

If the child/ward is medically excused from school for an extended length of time, arrangements will be made on how the child/ward can be supported with homework and other areas of academic needs.

<b>5. What Huaminites Should Do</b><br>
In order to attain the full benefits from the value of homework, Huaminites should do the following on a daily basis:

*   Refer to the homework whiteboard in the classroom for homework assignments.
*   Record the homework assignments in the Student Handbook with the estimated completion time written.

*   Seek clarification on the given homework before going back home.

*   Ensure that homework assignments are brought home to be completed and not left in school.
*   Manage time well to ensure that homework is completed and submitted on time.
*   Give his/her best effort in completing the homework.
