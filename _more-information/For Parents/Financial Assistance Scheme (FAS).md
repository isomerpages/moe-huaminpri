Other relatives who are dependent on the family and live at the same residential address may be included on a case-by-case basis.<br>
The MOE FAS has to be renewed annually subject to re-verification of household income, and household members if Per Capita Income basis is used.

<u>Application for Computer Under IMDA’s NEU PC Plus Programme</u><br>
The NEU PC Plus Programme administered by the Infocomm Media Development Authority of Singapore (IMDA) offers students from low income households the opportunity to own a new computer at a subsidised price. MOE has collaborated with IMDA to reach out to potential beneficiaries of the NEU PC Plus Programme, by including an item in the MOE FAS application form for parents to indicate whether they wish to apply for a computer under the programme if they had not benefited from the programme in the last 3 years. For those who wish to apply and their application for MOE FAS is approved, the school will give them the simplified IMDA form for the NEU PC Plus Programme to complete and help them send to the relevant lead agency to process.
