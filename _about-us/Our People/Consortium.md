### **The School's Consortium**

Huamin is made up of three Consortiums, each comprising two levels. The rationale for this structure is to bring about more streamlined programmes and ensure a more effective transition for the students between the levels.

<center><b style="color:#016C62;">The three Consortiums are:</b><br>
<b style="color:#016C62;">Lower Primary:</b>Primary One and Primary Two<br>
<b style="color:#016C62;">Middle Primary:</b> Primary Three and Primary Four<br>
<b style="color:#016C62;">Upper Primary:</b> Primary Five and Primary Six</center>


<p style="text-align:left;">Every Consortium is led by a dynamic individual who is known as the Year Head and guided by a philosophy to achieve its goals. All our staff and programmes in the school are aligned to the philosophies.</p>
