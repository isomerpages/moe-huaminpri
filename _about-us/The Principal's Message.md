### **Principal's Message**

<img src="/images/MdmLoe2023.jpg" alt="Mdm Loe 2023" style="float:left; width: 300px; height: 450px;">At Huamin Primary School, we recognise our students as unique individuals with strengths and interests. Underscored by the school value 'Everyone is Special' and the belief that 'Every student can learn, and want to learn,' all staff role-modeled support for student well-being in daily routines and school programmes. The school intentionally adopts the tagline 'A Happy Learning Place where students Love to Learn and Learn to Love' to undergird the importance of quality Teacher-Student Relationships and Student-Student Relationships.
<br>
Education is a lifelong journey. Our vision is to develop every Huaminite to become a self-directed learner and a passionate contributor. By providing our students with a myriad of quality learning experiences, we aim for them to discover the joy of learning and develop good Huaminite habits anchored on HEART values. Learning through the experiences, our students will build resilience, learn to work as a team, and put others before themselves.
<br>
To achieve this vision and prepare them to be future-ready, it takes a community of stakeholders with shared goals and values to help our Huaminities grow and glow. As partners-in-education, your strong partnership based on mutual understanding, respect, and trust will help Huaminities realize the school's motto, "Aspire to Excel"!
<br>
<br>
**Sincerely yours,<br>
Mdm Loe Lai Pink
