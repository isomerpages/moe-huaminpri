### **Principal's Message**

<img src="/images/Mdmloe.png" alt="Mdm Loe" style="float:left;width:42px;height:42px;">It is indeed an honor and delight for me to take over the principalship from Mdm Noorismawaty Ismail. Under her leadership, Huamin has lived up to its Motto, 'Aspire to Excel' and grown from strength to strength. I would like to wish her the best in her new undertakings on behalf of our staff and stakeholders.

In Huamin Primary, to nurture all students to be their best, the school sets out to create a happy learning place, where students learn to love and love to learn. Learning in a safe and empowering environment is fundamental to a child's growth. From as early as in Primary 1, teachers use the acronym 'STAR’ (Sense of curiosity, Tenacity in Learning, Agile & Flexible and Responsible) to guide our students to overcome challenges with a positive mindset in their daily school life and experiences. 

Focusing on developing these positive learning dispositions in our students is key to developing positive learning attitudes for life. As a school, we strive to forge strong partnerships with parents to create a caring culture to bring out the best in your child.

My teachers and I look forward to working with you and your child in the new school year and building upon the school's progress. We will continue to nurture a strong culture of care and excellence in the school community. On this note, I would like to warmly welcome all students, especially our new Primary 1 cohort in 2022, for an exciting time of learning and growth.<br>
Wishing you the best for 2022, and let’s look forward to a great year ahead!

Sincerely yours,<br>
Mdm Loe Lai Pink
