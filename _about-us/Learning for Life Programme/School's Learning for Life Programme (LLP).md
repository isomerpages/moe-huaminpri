### **Huamin's Learning for Life Programme (LLP)**
HMPS had been accorded the status as the first UNESCO Associated Schools Project Network, or ASPnet School in Singapore since November 2014. This prestigious honour was commissioned by UNESCO HQ in Paris and recognised worldwide. It is an affirmation of the school’s efforts in encouraging the arts and culture (Culture Domain), as well as in promoting and keeping the environment clean and green (Environment Domain). The school’s LLP and ALP (Visual Arts and Interdisciplinary) continues to strive to achieve the ESD outcomes as indicated in the ESD Framework. We were also one of the shortlisted entries out of 90 from schools in South-East Asia, for the SEAMEO-JAPAN ESD Award in 2015.
