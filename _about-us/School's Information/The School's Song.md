Here at Huamin, We Keenly Work and Play
Growing Stronger with Every Passing Day
Strong in Body and Strong in Mind
Moving Forward, We are Never Left Behind
We Do Strive to Do the Best All the Way
Being Healthy and Happy Every Day
Setting High Aims with Brawn and Brain
Brightly Shine in All Our Studies, Sports and Games
When at Huamin's Gate, We Then Shall Part
Huamin Will Always be Dear to Our Heart
We Will Face a World of Tomorrow
Carrying "Aspire to Excel" Our Motto
Here at Huamin, We Keenly Work and Play
Making Good Friends and Having Lots of Fun
Aspiring to Excel
Preparing for Tomorrow When It Comes
Preparing for Tomorrow When It Comes.
