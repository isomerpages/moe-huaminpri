<center>Here at Huamin, We Keenly Work and Play<br>
Growing Stronger with Every Passing Day<br>
Strong in Body and Strong in Mind<br>
Moving Forward, We are Never Left Behind<br>
We Do Strive to Do the Best All the Way<br>
Being Healthy and Happy Every Day<br>
Setting High Aims with Brawn and Brain<br>
Brightly Shine in All Our Studies, Sports and Games<br>
When at Huamin's Gate, We Then Shall Part<br>
Huamin Will Always be Dear to Our Heart<br>
We Will Face a World of Tomorrow<br>
Carrying "Aspire to Excel" Our Motto<br>
Here at Huamin, We Keenly Work and Play<br>
Making Good Friends and Having Lots of Fun<br>
Aspiring to Excel<br>
Preparing for Tomorrow When It Comes<br>
Preparing for Tomorrow When It Comes.<br></p>
