The original government-aided Hua Mien School, established in 1945, was situated at 226, Jalan Ulu Sembawang. The old School relocated to the premises of Northland Primary School in 1988 while waiting for the new school building to be ready.

After 3 years of waiting, Hua Mien School finally reopened its doors in Yishun New Town under the new name - Huamin Primary School in 1989. Huamin Primary School was officially opened on 22 November 1991 by MP for Sembawang GRC, A/P Ho Peng Kee.

Mr Foo Chee Meng was the first principal when the school started in 1989. In December 1990, Mr Cher Kheng Wah took over the Principalship followed by Mrs Rashidah Marican in 1998, Mr William Pushpam in 2003, Mr Edmund Lim W.K. in 2010, Mdm Noorismawaty Bte Ismail in 2013. Our current principal is Mdm Loe Lai Pink, whom had joined us in December 2021.

Huamin is in the N6 Cluster Schools, which is under the able guidance of our Superintendent, Mrs Edelweis Neo.
