#### **Our Signature Programme**

HMPS’s vision of arts education is for every Huaminite to be a Connoisseur of the Arts - one who enjoys and appreciates the arts, demonstrates a high level of interest, and is self-motivated and committed towards the arts.  This leads towards the realisation of the school’s vision of Self-Directed Learners and Passionate Contributors.

The Visual Arts Curriculum at HMPS encompasses C.A.P.s (Creative Arts Programme), which provides the opportunity for all students to experience a comprehensive range of visual arts proficiencies. These include Ceramics, Print Making, Digital Art, Museum-Based Learning and Art Appreciation. Integrated Project Work in the Visual Arts Curriculum engages students in their arts learning experiences, through collaboration and active learning. These projects help our students to deepen their learning and allow them to make meaningful connections between the various subjects, such as recycling in Science, culture and values in CCE and Digital Art in ICT.

The learning of Visual Arts goes beyond that of art techniques and appreciation. One of our key strengths lies in leveraging the school’s Applied Learning Programme (ALP) Interdisciplinary to collaborate with community and overseas partners. Working on these collaborative projects allow our students to inculcate and exhibit the various values desired, such as teamwork, proactiveness, striving for excellence and being goal-oriented. The different collaborative platforms also expand our students’ minds and challenge them to develop their creativity.  The project works provide an opportunity for our students to learn and work together through visual arts and to interact with the community and youths from different cultures and countries. These opportunities inculcate in our students the awareness of and sensitivity towards local and global issues as they strive to be a “Self-Directed Lr and Passionate Contributor.”
