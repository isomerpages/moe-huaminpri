We have a structured Snack break daily (except Wednesdays when there is a lunch break) at 8:25am (for P4, P5 and P6 students) and 11:25am (for P1, P2 and P3 students). Students are allowed to consume a healthy snack during this break in class then.

Combining technology with the proven use of the OMNI scale during PE lessons and Sports CCA. Using the Polar© OH1 Heart Rate monitor, we equip our students with the knowledge and skill of using the OMNI scale to learn to identify their Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE) and therefore, regulate their own exercise intensity accordingly to ensure that they are exercising at a safe and sustainable manner.

**Programme for Active Learning (PAL):**<br>
PAL: Huamin Primary School was one of the schools selected by MOE to pilot the Programme for Active Learning (PAL) in 2010. Under PAL, our students will participate in modular activities in four broad areas of:
1. Sports and Games
2. Outdoor Education
3. Performing Arts (Drama)
4. Visual Arts

PAL allows students to have a broad exposure to a range of activities at an entry level, so that they can discover their talents and interests, be it in the outdoors, sports or the aesthetics. Our students learn through play and are engaged in fun and varied activities during PAL. PAL is a powerful vehicle to develop Social Emotional Learning competencies, nurture life skills and values within all students.

**Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs):**<br>
CCA: Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs) play an integral role in the holistic development of our students. There are 18 different CCAs offered in the school. They range from competitive and recreational sports to Aesthetics: Performing Arts and Visual Arts to Clubs and Uniformed Group. Through students’ active participation in CCA, we will be able to nurture and inculcate values such as self-discipline, teamwork, sense of responsibility and sportsmanship. All Primary 3 to 6 students are highly encouraged to participate in one CCA.
