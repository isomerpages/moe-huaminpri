### **Mathematics**

<b style="color:#016C62; font-size:20px; line-height: 3;">OUR MISSION</b><br>
The school is committed in providing a conducive and nurturing environment for her students to acquire problem solving skills. The Math Department aims to develop students with strong Mathematical skills as well as inculcate in them a love for the subject. As Math is an essential part of everyday life, the department strives to adopt a fun and an effective way to instil in students with the necessary skills to tackle problem based questions.

The Mathematics programme aims to provide appropriate learning experiences to enable students to:
<p style="color:#038C7F; line-height: 1.75;">
   -   Acquire from concrete to pictorial to abstract the necessary Math knowledge, concepts and skills and apply them for problem solving<br>
   -   Enhance their Mathematical thinking and reasoning skills through solving of Mathematical problems<br>
   -   Develop positive attitudes such as sense of achievement, confidence, perseverance and enjoyment<br>
   -   Cultivate positive group dynamic<br>
</p>

<b style="color:#016C62; font-size:20px; line-height: 3;">BROAD AIM</b><br>
The broad aims of mathematics education in Singapore are to enable students to:

<p style="color:#038C7F; line-height: 1.75;">
 - acquire and apply mathematical concepts and skills; <br>
   -   develop cognitive and metacognitive skills through a mathematical approach to problem solving; and <br>
   -   develop positive attitudes towards mathematics.
</p>

<b style="color:#016C62; font-size:20px; line-height: 3;">OVERARCHING AIM</b><br>
To ensure that all students will achieve a level of mastery of mathematics that will serve them well in life, and for those who have the interest and ability, to pursue mathematics at the highest possible level.

<b style="color:#016C62; font-size:20px; line-height: 3;">Our Department's Approach</b><br>
**RMPDC** <br>
We use the Read, Mark out, Plan, Do, Check (RMPDC) approach for Math problem solving. This approach helps the students to understand the problem, devise a plan, solve the question and check their work. 

Read - Students to read the question to understand it.

Mark - out Students will do annotation to mark out the important information.

Plan - Students to devise a plan to find a solution to the problem.

Do - Students to use appropriate strategies to solve the problem.

Check	- Students to check their work using strategies such as working backwards to ensure the accuracy of their solution. 

**ICAN** <br>
Improving Confidence and Achievement in Numeracy (ICAN)is a collaboration with MOE which aims to raise the confidence level of low readiness students and also to improve their overall performance.

**E-Pedagogy** <br>
E-pedagogy in Mathematics is the practice of teaching with technology using tools to create a more participatory, connected and reflective classroom for engaged learningS. The Math teachers use tools such as SLS, Koobits, Nearpod and Classkick in their lessons.

<b style="color:#016C62; font-size:20px; line-height: 3;">Math Department Programmes</b><br>
**E2K** <br>
The E2K Mathematics Programme is a Mathematics Programme for selected Primary 4 and 5 students with interest and aptitude for Mathematics. The programme aims to nurture excellence in the education of Mathematics , creativity and leadership among young people. The overall main objectives are to develop abilities of independent learning, foster abilities and strengthen students’ confidence in those abilities; reinforce their perception of self as an independent and mature learner and investigator. 

**Parent-Child Activity** <br>
As part of the school’s effort to promote home-school partnership, the lower primary students are working on parent-child activities via SLS. These activities will enable them to make connections to the real world that Mathematics is all around them and also as a reinforcement of what they have learnt in class.
