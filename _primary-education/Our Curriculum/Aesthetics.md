<b style="color:#016C62; font-size:20px; line-height: 3;">VISUAL ARTS</b><br>
Through the various art modules within the Modular Visual Arts Curriculum â€“ C.A.P.s, all students are given the opportunity to experience a comprehensive range of visual arts proficiencies across the primary education at HMPS. The modules are Ceramics, Print Making, Clay Tile Relief, Sculpture, Digital Art and Art Appreciation.

In terms of teaching & learning, the department adopts P4C (Philosophy For Children) within its curriculum as a key teaching pedagogy where teachers incorporate the use of artful thinking routines at the beginning of their visual arts lessons as part of Art Appreciation. Students are encouraged to enhance and strengthen their cognitive thinking where they have to justify their responses which encourage deeper thinking and critical-thinking for the subject. Students will learn to listen and accept the different opinions raised to have a better understanding of an artwork in relation to its background, tradition and culture.

Students who are keen and interested to cultivate and further develop their talent and interest in visual arts are invited to join the intensive art enrichment programme of the Art Club. These students also work in group projects as they continue to develop in their strengths and participate in the various competitions for exposure and experience.
