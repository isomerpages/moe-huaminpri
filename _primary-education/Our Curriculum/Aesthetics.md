HMPS believes in nurturing the creative minds of every child. Our Visual Arts Curriculum is designed to inspire young minds, foster their imagination and develop a lifelong appreciation for the arts. Through a diverse range of artistic experiences within C.A.P.s (Creative Arts Programme), students are provided with opportunities to explore and nurture their visual arts proficiencies in Ceramics, Print Making, Digital Art, Museum-Based Learning and Art Appreciation; encouraging them to express, think critically, and explore the world through creative lenses. 

Within the curriculum, the Integrated Project Work engages students in their arts learning experiences as well, through collaboration and active learning. These projects help our students to deepen their learning and allow them to make meaningful connections between the various subjects, such as Environment in Science, Culture and Values in CCE.

Our Visual Arts Programme, comprises of both curricular and co-curricular activities, aims to inspire creativity, critical thinking, and self-expression, enabling our students to become confident and passionate contributors. Students who are keen and interested to cultivate and further develop their talent and interest in visual art are also invited to join the art co-curricular activities of the Art and Ceramics Clubs. Through our comprehensive curriculum, instructions and engaging projects, we aim to foster a lifelong appreciation for the arts and empower our students to make a positive impact through their artistic endeavors.
