#### Programme

**Student Leadership Programme** <br>
A structured leadership programme is implemented to develop students’ leadership potential and educate them on the various skills and qualities of good leadership. The 7 Huaminite Habits are used as a guideline for these student leadership workshops. <br> <br>
The student leadership programmes are guided by the school’s Student Leadership Framework which looks into developing them through the three tiers of student leadership: Tier 1 (Lead Self), Tier 2 (Lead Peer) and Tier 3 (Lead School).  <br><br>
Student leaders are also appraised by themselves, peers and teachers. These evaluations help them to become better leaders. Students are encouraged to practise leadership through prefectorial committee, class committee and house committee.
