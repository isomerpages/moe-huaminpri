#### Programme

**Student Leadership Programme** <br>
A structured leadership programme is implemented to develop students’ leadership potential and educate them on the various skills and qualities of good leadership. The 7 Huaminite Habits are used as a guideline for these student leadership workshops. <br> <br>
The student leadership programmes are guided by the school’s Student Leadership Framework which looks into developing them through the three tiers of student leadership: Tier 1 (Lead Self), Tier 2 (Lead Peer) and Tier 3 (Lead School).  <br><br>
Student leaders are also appraised by themselves, peers and teachers. These evaluations help them to become better leaders. Students are encouraged to practise leadership through prefectorial committee, class committee and house committee.

This is a character programme to inculcate positive habits in every Huaminite so they are equipped with the essential and practical skills beyond their primary school education.

**Customised Social Skills Lessons** <br>
Social Skills lessons are incorporated into FTGP curriculum to better help students manage their SEL competencies and interactions with others. Students are taught explicit steps to apply a targeted social skill. For example, the school adopts Social Skill ‘Use an appropriate voice level’, apart from going through what this particular social skill is in designated FTGP periods, &nbsp;the implementation of Volume Meter school-wide also allows students to self-regulate their voice level and learn to speak at an appropriate level at various settings.

**VIA in HMPS - HEAD, HEART and HAND** <br>
Values-in-Action (VIA) activities are planned and carried out across all levels based on a 6-year plan. Students learn to serve through the 3H approach, also known as Head, Heart and Hand, whereby they apply the values, habits and skills learnt in school to the organisations that they are serving.


**Routinized Daily Clean-up in Huamin Primary School (VIA)** <br>
To provide Huaminites with opportunities to develop into Passionate Contributors, the school has also implemented the routinised daily clean-up programme since 2014. This is part of the Values-in-Action 6-year plan for the school.

Students are rostered to clean up their classrooms at the beginning of the day for approximately five minutes before they commence their first lesson of the day. At the end of the day just before the dismissal bell rings, they are required to clean up the classroom for another five minutes during the last period. This routine also coincides with the cleaning up routine of our school OSO staff where they make their rounds in the school compound to do a quick sweep and clean-up of the school, which makes it a whole-school clean-up routine.

The CCE coordinator also carries out a “Cleanest Class Award” per term to affirm the class that demonstrates commitment and consistency in maintaining classroom cleanliness. There are rubrics placed in each class to spell out the expectations on what the students in the rostered cleanliness committee can do to upkeep their classrooms. Their form or subject teachers can also refer to the rubrics to do a quick assessment on the cleanliness of the classroom at any time of the day apart from their fixed clean-up routine.

In addition, each consortium (two levels per consortium) is rostered to clean up school areas like the canteen, foyer and field right after the recess bell. Parent volunteers from the Parent Support Group are also co-opted to perform recess duties during this period. They are involved in leading the students during the clean-up duty. They also advise and remind the students to observe proper hygiene and wash their hands before going back to class. Students have given positive reviews about this clean-up and they learn to be responsible and proactive. By engaging in everyday responsibilities, we cultivate good habits for life. Respect and consideration for others is also shown by taking care of our shared spaces like the canteen. In addition, by taking ownership of our environment, we learn to value all labour that serves a useful purpose in society.

**Beary Best Award and Caught You Doing Great** <br>
Beary Best Award is a recognition given out by HMPS monthly for classes which have displayed excellent behaviour, good school habits and discipline. Winning classes from the lower and middle consortium would have the privilege of having a certificate and Mr Bear in class for the month, while the upper consortium would receive a certification of recognition for their good behaviour.

Caught You Doing Great is also a student recognition platform where the school showcases positive acts performed by the students. These actions are "captured" by the teachers in the school and students are praised for their good behaviour.


**Clean Plate Campaign**<br>
The “Clean Plate Campaign” is a joint-collaboration with Food from the Heart (FFTH) and Huamin Primary School since 2016 in hope to educate students on the importance of reducing food wastage by inculcating the habit of mindful eating when they are young. Students are encouraged to order food of appropriate proportions during recess time in order not to waste food that they are unable to finish. Yearly, personnel from FFTH also visits the school to educate them about the repercussions of food waste, which is a global issue, and students are able to show their support by ‘cleaning up’ their plates.

**NE Ambassadors** <br>
NE Ambassadors are selected from each class to share updates on current affairs and messages on National Education. It is also a platform to develop student leadership. In HMPS, NE Ambassadors are given the opportunity to lead the school in the morning assembly. They are also given the chance to carry out public speaking through assembly talks and class sharing.

**Internationalisation Programme** <br>
The Internationalisation Programme aims to inculcate a deeper sense of belonging and understanding for Singapore with the school’s international students as well as their families through yearly programmes run by the school. This includes tea-appreciation ceremony, heritage learning journeys and even workshops.

**Friend of Singa Ambassador (FOS) Programme** <br>
In the hope to create a kinder and more caring community within Huamin, we started our collaboration with Singapore Kindness Movement since 2016 on the Friend of Singa (FOS) programme.&nbsp; Selected student ambassadors will complete a kindness project within their school to promote the values of kindness and graciousness through the Design Thinking Approach. Through the activities planned and executed, we hope to inculcate courteous behaviour amongst our students.

**You Say Your Say – Students' Suggestions / Feedback Scheme**<br>
Students are invited to have a say in the school and are encouraged to submit their suggestions and feedback to the school management pertaining to Student Well-being, Student Safety (“Safety Begins With You”) and Student Discipline. Students whose suggestions are accepted would receive tokens of appreciation and their implemented ideas will be shared with the school.

**Education &amp; Career Guidance Fiesta** <br>
In line with MOE’s directive to equip students with the necessary knowledge, skills and values to make informed decisions at each key education stage for successful transition from school to further education or work, and hence to manage their career pathways and lifelong learning throughout their lives. The school’s ECG programmes are guided by its 6-year plan aimed to Excite, Exposure and Educate the respective consortiums of the student population.

**Social Studies Curriculum** <br>
The Social Studies curriculum works hand in hand with the NE programmes in the school to provide all Huaminites a well-rounded education about Singapore and the world.&nbsp;  <br>
a) Primary 1 - Knowing Myself, Others and My Surroundings  
b) Primary 2 - Coming Together as a Nation  
c) Primary 3 - Understanding Singapore  
d) Primary 4 - Valuing Our Past - (Inquiry Focus) How is life in Singapore today shaped by what happened in the past?  
e) Primary 5 - Appreciating The World - (Inquiry Focus) How has the legacies of the world impacted our lives today?  
f) Primary 6 - Discovering Southeast Asia - (Inquiry Focus) How is Southeast Asia important to Singapore?

The Inquiry Focus approach is also recommended for the learning of concepts, skills and exploration of topics in Social Studies.

In Huamin Primary School, students develop greater empathy through a customised Social Studies curriculum incorporating Drama-in-Education (D.i.E.) conventions into the lessons.

Using different readers, teachers spark an exciting sense of curiosity in students by infusing D.i.E. strategies to stimulate discussions, collaboration and critical thinking to promote full educative growth of the students as individuals and as social beings.

Through fuss-free activities like thought tracking, letter writing, student-in-role and hot seat, students use the information and data collected to discuss and reflect on the challenges posed, with the teachers playing the role of a facilitator. These help to equip students with the knowledge, skills and values that will enable them to become effective citizens, workers and leaders in the 21st century.

The tone of the lessons is also student-centric, allowing students the opportunities to use reasoning skills to brainstorm, discuss and overcome the challenges posed during the sessions, making them reflective in the process as well.
