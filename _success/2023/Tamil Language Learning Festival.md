Tamil Language Learning Festival at UPTLC for Primary 5 Students  
On Saturday, 15 April 2023, our P5 Tamil Language students attended a Tamil Language Learning Festival @Umar Pulavar Tamil Language Centre (UPTLC) in conjunction with the Tamil Language Festival.  
  
They participated in both language and culture-based activities. Some of the activities were Video Animation Creation whereby students had to plan a short scene and do a voice-over for the cartoon characters. They then presented the video clip to the audience. The other activity was a culture-based one involving the creation of a coaster using coconut leaves. Our students also participated enthusiastically in several other activities.  
  
It was a meaningful and enjoyable experience for our students where they were immersed in a language-rich environment and where they also had the opportunity to interact and learn with peers from other schools
