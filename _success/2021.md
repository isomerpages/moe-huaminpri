<b style="color:#016C62; font-size:20px;">National Chinese Picture Book Creative Competition</b><br>
In November 2020, three of our Huaminites, Dayna Zaidi (6 Respect), Allison Ong Rui En (6 Respect) and Chloe Tan Ding Hui (6 Integrity), joined the  **National Chinese Picture Book Creative Competition** organised by Nan Hua Primary School.  We are proud to announce that out of the 83 submissions from 37 schools nationwide, we achieved the **National Silver Award**!

<img src="/images/National Chinese Picture Book.png" alt="National Chinese Picture Book" style="float:left;margin-right:25px;">Dayna, Allison and Chloe authored and illustrated their book entitled ‘国王的考题  
The King’s Test)’. The 21 pages book tells the story of the king who gave his three sons an egg each and asked them to raise the best chick as a test of their readiness to assume the throne. However, the eggs were actually boiled eggs. The king wanted to find out who was the most honest among his three sons to be appointed as the next ruler. Images of the book are appended below.<br>
